Final project : oblique effect in target detection task among distractors
The task is a target detection task where the target is either an oblique or vertical line. The distractors are the other type of line (vertical or oblique line).
Hypothesis : when the target is an oblique line among vertical distractors, the subject is faster than when it is a vertical line among obliques.
Explanation : there is a "pop-out" phenomenon on the oblique stimuli since they are less present in our environement than vertical stimuli (often present because of gravity).
